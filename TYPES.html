    <h1>TYPES OF DIABETES</h1>
    <P>There are mainly three types of diabetes:</P>
    <li>Type 1 Diabetes</li>
    <li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
    <li>Gestational Diabetes</li>

    <div class="type one">
        <h1>TYPE 1 DIABETES</h1>
        <P>Type 1 Diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependant diabetes, is a chronic condition.In this condition, the pancrease makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar(glucose)to enter cells to produce energy.</P>
        <br>
        <p>Different factors such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes.Although type 1 Diabetes ususally appears during childhood or adolences, it  can develop in adults.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h1>Causes</h1>
   <p>The exact causes of Type 1 diabetes is unknown. usually, the body's own immune system- which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses- destroys the insulin-producing(islet)cells in the pancrease.</p>
    <p>Other possible causes include:</p>
    <li>Genetics</li>
    <li>Exposure to viruses and other  enviromental factors</li>
</div>
<div >
    <h1>TYP 2 DIABETES</h1>
    <P>Type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a problem in the way the body regulates and ses sugar as fuel. That sugar also is called glucose. This  long-term conditionresults in too much sugar circulating in the blood.Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems.</P>
<br>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people.</p>
<br>
<p>There is no cure for type 2 diabetes. losing weight, eating well and excercising can help manage diabetes. I f diet and excercise aren't enough to control blood Sugar, diabetes medications or insulin threrapy may be recommended</p>
</div>
     <div>
        <h1>GESTATIONAL DIABETES </h1>
        <p>Gestational diabetes is diabetes diagnosed for the first time during pregnacy(gestation) like other types of diabetes, gestation diabetes affects how youe cells use sugar(glucose) Gestation diabetes causes high blood sugar that can affect your pregnancy and your baby's health.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you have gestational diabetes during pregnancy, generrally your blood sugar returns to its usual level soon after delivery.But  if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes. you'll need to be tested for changes in the blood sugar more often</p>
